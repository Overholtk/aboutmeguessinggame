       <h2>Biography</h2>
         <p>I moved to Washington in 2009 from Texas, where I was born and raised. I just turned 25 in August and shortly after began my journey at Code Fellows. My boyfriend and I adopted 2 sister kittens that we named Nebula and Gamora, they are truly the light of my life. Their personalities fit their names extremely well. I love reading, currently the Witcher series and watching movies or shows that are captivating. As a family, we used to go see all of the LOTR movies in the before times. I love cosplaying, even though I haven't gotten that off the ground yet, Galadriel is one I really can't wait to represent. </p>
         <ul>
         <li> I graduated high school in 2013, I didn't pursue college as I did not know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I spent most of my time working and figuring out life and myself. I worked on self taught coding and reading, then decided to go for it and apply for Code Fellows! </li>
         <li>I've had a job since I was 16, mainly being in the service industry, aside from being a lifeguard for a few years! Throughout the service industry I was a shift supervisor, bartender, server and much more. A jack of all trades if you will. </li>
         <li> My overall goals are to come out of this program ready to be a full blown software developer that never stops learning. I would also love to build confidence in the public speaking department as I go! </li>
